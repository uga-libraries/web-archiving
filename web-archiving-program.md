# UGA Libraries Web Archiving Program

**July 2019**


# Purpose

The University of Georgia Libraries is engaged in web archiving in order to capture and preserve at-risk content that is in alignment with our collecting areas and to expand collecting into areas like student life, activism, and local elections which are primarily documented through social media.


# Collecting Areas

The UGA Libraries will collect websites and social media accounts related to the following areas:

*   Web presence of individuals and organizations who donate papers to the archives.

*   University of Georgia: mission-critical information that is only available in electronic form and student life, which is increasingly best-documented by social media.

*   Social media presence of Congressional members.

*   Disability history advocacy.

*   Anti-discrimination and grassroots political organizations.

*   Elections.


# Permissions to Crawl

When there is already a deed of gift or other formalization of a collecting relationship, no further permissions will be required prior to crawling web content. In all other cases, the UGA Libraries will send the website owner a notification of our intent to collect the site and offer them the option of declining. Unless requested not to crawl by the website owner within a month, the UGA Libraries will proceed with collecting the site.

Restrictions on crawling as recorded in robots.txt files will be considered as part of the decision to crawl. If critical components of the site, such as photographs or stylesheets, are blocked by robots.txt, the restriction will be ignored provided that the UGA Libraries has a collecting relationship with the website owner or has previously notified the website owner of the intent to crawl and received no objection.

The owner of the intellectual property rights of any content crawled by the UGA Libraries may request that archived content be removed from the Archive-It website. Requests are reviewed by the department head of the collecting library, and the University Librarian if warranted. This procedure is detailed in the [Take Down Policy](take-down-policy.md).


# Access

Unless otherwise requested by the website owner, access to crawls is provided immediately via the Archive-It web interface.


# Roles and Responsibilities

The Head of Digital Stewardship serves as the administrator of the account and coordinates the program. A group composed of the account administrator and a representative from each department that is actively web archiving make decisions about the program, with input from departments that are considering web archiving in the future.
