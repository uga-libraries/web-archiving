UGA Archived Web Content Take Down Policy
======
September 2019


# Policy Overview and Scope

## Purpose

The UGA Libraries makes archived versions of web content (websites and content from various social media platforms) created by third parties available online for educational purposes. The site owner is contacted prior to making the web content available. If a copyright holder feels the content is provided online in error, they may request that the content be removed from the UGA Libraries web presence in accordance with this policy.

## Who can request content be taken down

The copyright holder of the content.

## Who approves or denies requests

The head of the department that makes the content available online.

## Content covered by this policy

Archived web content that the UGA Libraries has made available online, including via the Libraries website and vendor platforms such as Archive-It. It does not include copies of content that other entities have acquired and made available online, such as archived websites in the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. The copyright holder is responsible for contacting each entity separately to request that their content be removed from the web.

# Procedure

1. A person contacts the UGA Libraries in writing to request content be taken down from the UGA Libraries web presence ("the requestor"). The request should include a description of the content and an assertion that they are the copyright holder.

2. The department head confirms that the requestor is the copyright holder and if so approves the request. If not, the request is denied. If there is uncertainty about how the request should be handled, the department head confers with the University Librarian. During this time, the content generally remains available online. If the request is sensitive, public access to the content can be suspended during review.

3. The department head sends a written response to the requester within 5 business days. Sample responses are provided in the next section, [Example Letters](#example-letters).

4. If the request is approved, the department head notifies the administrator of the UGA Libraries Archive-It account (Head of Digital Stewardship, Adriane Hanson) and the staff member in their department responsible for web archiving.

    The account administrator submits a request to the Internet Archive to remove all access to the content from the site. This typically takes 24 hours to take effect.

    The staff member updates any online description of the web content to indicate that it has been removed at the request of the copyright holder, adds a restriction note to the content in the preservation system, and adds a note to any internal collection management documentation.

5. A copy of all correspondence between the UGA Libraries and the requester is kept in the department's permanent records, regardless of if the request is approved or denied.

6. A copy of the web content remains in the UGA Libraries preservation system, where access is restricted to staff members only. When the copyright term has expired, we can provide access again.

# Example Letters

Please note that other entities, including the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, may have also collected your web content. You will need to contact each entity separately to have them remove your content from their sites as well.

## Content will not be removed

Thank you for your request to remove [description of content] from the UGA Libraries websites. We can only remove content from our website at the request of the copyright holder.
