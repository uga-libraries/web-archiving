# Purpose

The University of Georgia Libraries is engaged in web archiving in order to capture and preserve at-risk content that is in alignment with our collecting areas and to expand collecting into areas like student life, activism, and local elections which are primarily documented through social media. Additionally, we use web archiving in support of our responsibilities as the official depository for Georgia state government publications.


# Collecting Areas

The UGA Libraries will collect websites and social media accounts related to the following areas:

*   Web presence of individuals and organizations who donate papers to the archives.

*   Georgia state government agencies and organizations, with an emphasis on the executive branch.

*   University of Georgia: mission-critical information that is only available in electronic form and student life, which is increasingly best-documented by social media.

*   Social media presence of Congressional members.

*   Disability history advocacy.

*   Anti-discrimination and grassroots political organizations.

*   Elections.


# Permissions to Crawl

When there is already a deed of gift or other formalization of a collecting relationship, no further permissions will be required prior to crawling web content. In all other cases, the UGA Libraries will send the site owner a notification of our intent to collect the site and offer them the option of declining. Unless requested not to crawl by the site owner within four weeks, the UGA Libraries will proceed with collecting the site.

Restrictions on crawling as recorded in robots.txt files will be considered as part of the decision to crawl. If critical components of the site, such as photographs or stylesheets, are blocked by robots.txt, the restriction will be ignored provided that the UGA Libraries has a collecting relationship with the site owner or has previously notified the site owner of the intent to crawl and received no objection.

The owner of the intellectual property rights of any content crawled by the UGA Libraries may request that archived content be removed from the Archive-It website. Requests are reviewed by the department head of the collecting library, and the University Librarian if warranted. This procedure is detailed in the [Take Down Policy](take-down-policy.md).


# Access

Unless otherwise requested by the site owner, access to crawls is provided immediately via the Archive-It web interface.


# Preservation

The UGA Libraries downloads a copy of all WARCs and a subset of the metadata reports from Archive-It for local preservation in our digital preservation system (ARCHive). While Archive-It does provide good digital preservation of crawled content, it is important for us to have local control over these irreplaceable resources. 


# Roles and Responsibilities

The administrator and crawlers make decisions about the program collectively, with input from departments that are considering web archiving in the future as appropriate. This includes managing use of the quota, deciding on the quota required for the next year, and changes to policies and procedures.

* **Administrator:** The Head of Digital Stewardship (Adriane Hanson) serves as the administrator of the account and coordinates the program. They manage user accounts and onboard new users, oversee subscription renewals, facilitate communication between users of Archive-It, run the quarterly preservation downloads, and monitor the web archiving landscape to keep our policies and practices in line with professional best practices. Permissions in Archive-It: Administrator. The Digital Archivist (currently vacant) serves as the backup administrator.

* **Crawlers:** The primary users of the account. Their responsibilities include running test crawls, quality assurance, saving content to permanent collections, and creating metadata. Permissions in Archive-It: User.

* **Testers:** Users who are considering adopting web archiving for their department. They can view crawl reports and private sites in the Wayback Machine. They may not save content to permanent collections. The administrator runs test crawls for them. Permissions in Archive-It: Contributor.
