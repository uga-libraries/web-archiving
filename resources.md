# Access and User Needs

[**Archives Unleashed Project**](https://archivesunleashed.org/)

Archives Unleashed aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past. Supported by a grant from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org), we are developing web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars, librarians and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.

The increasing use and prominence of web archives raises the urgency of establishing mechanisms for transparency in the making of web archives to facilitate the process of evaluating a web archive’s provenance, scoping, and absences. Some choices and process events are captured automatically, but their interactions are not currently well understood or documented. This study examines the decision space of web archives and its role in shaping what is and what is not captured in the web archiving process. By comparing how three different web archives collections were created and documented, we investigate how curatorial decisions interact with technical and external factors and we compare commonalities and differences. The findings reveal the need to understand both the social and technical context that shapes those decisions and the ways in which these individual decisions interact. Based on the study, we propose a framework for documenting key dimensions of a collection that addresses the situated nature of the organizational context, technical specificities, and unique characteristics of web materials that are the focus of a collection. The framework enables future researchers to undertake empirical work studying the process of creating web archives collections in different contexts.

This research gives us a greater understanding of the awareness and use our collection of archived websites by university academics, and will help us explore future archiving options. As the Library developed New Zealand’s web archive, we often stated that the activity was not for current researchers, but for our future generations to use as a resource to understand the present. As such, we emphasised collecting and preserving over improving discovery, access and usability. The results of this survey not only show that there’s a demand that is current, but more is wanted and expected from this unique resource in the very near future. When it comes to the history of the New Zealand web, the academic community are telling us that the future is now.

# Case Studies

[**Antracoli, Alexis, Steven Duckworth, Judith Silva, and Kristen Yarmey (2014) "Capture All the URLs: First Steps in Web Archiving," _Pennsylvania Libraries: Research & Practice_: Vol. 2: No. 2**](https://doi.org/10.5195/palrap.2014.67)

As higher education embraces new technologies, university activities-including teaching, learning, and research-increasingly take place on university websites, on university-related social media pages, and elsewhere on the open Web. Despite perceptions that "once it's on the Web, it's there forever," this dynamic digital content is highly vulnerable to degradation and loss. In order to preserve and provide enduring access to this complex body of university records, archivists and librarians must rise to the challenge of Web archiving. As digital archivists at our respective institutions, the authors introduce the concept of Web archiving and articulate its importance in higher education. We provide our institutions' rationale for selecting subscription service Archive-It as a preservation tool, outline the progress of our institutional Web archiving initiatives, and share lessons learned, from unexpected stumbling blocks to strategies for raising funds and support from campus stakeholders.

This case study explores the formation, current membership, and future goals  of the Kansas Archive-It Consortium (KAIC), one of the largest consortia contracting with the Web archiving service Archive-It. KAIC, which is composed of the state historical society and five public universities, has its foundation in a statewide culture of collaboration, and participants have agreed on an informal governance structure with a strong commitment to broadening accessible Web resources for researchers. After establishing consortial consistency during its first two years, members have shared documentation with partners and are beginning to do collaborative collecting. In the future, the consortium will seek additional members and work with Archive-It to develop a consortial search tool. This Web archiving collaborative has helped member institutions overcome challenges by having group discussions, sharing documentation and guidelines, and jointly serving a primary user group, Kansas residents.

# Description

[**Archive It Integration, NYU Libraries**](https://github.com/NYULibraries/Archivesspace-DO-Plugin/wiki/Archive-It-Integration)

The Archivesspace-DO-Plugin includes an endpoint designed for integration with Archive-It. The endpoint generates a json response that provides the title, number of digital objects, and a link to provide a user with more information about a collection for a resource in Archivesspace. The URL can be used to create a link between a resource in Archivesspace and a see URL that has been archived in Archive-It.

[**Bartczak, Jeremy, Elizabeth Wilkinson, and Lauren Work (2018) "University of Virginia Web Archiving Metadata Application Profile, Version 1.0"**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5kTUtUjob7YB7MpEd_Jl5lRsuZprxNZQZ6rELmJjeE)

This application profile provides a consolidated set of resources for standardizing and streamlining descriptive metadata workflows for web archives at the University of Virginia Library. The Library uses the Archive-It web archiving tool, which includes a Dublin Core compliant metadata editor, to perform this work. The Element Set is a list of required and optional Dublin Core fields (with the exception of Collector) along with notes for element refinement or additional explanation.

Automating description for Web Archives in ArchivesSpace using the Archive-It CDX and Partner Data APIs. This script looks for a specific subject in ArchivesSpace and if the archival objects assigned to that subject have a phystech note with the URL of the web archives collection, it will append child objects for each unique capture with details from &lt;meta> tags and provenance information from the Archive-It partner data API. It will add digital objects with links to archives web pages, and finally it will update dates and extents for all parent objects.

WAM's overall objective was to develop practices for creating consistent metadata that address the unique characteristics of websites and collections. More specifically:

*   Develop community-neutral, standards-neutral practices for descriptive metadata for archived web content, taking into account the needs of end users and metadata practitioners.
*   Define a lean set of data elements with usage notes to guide the preparation of data content.
*   Ensure that the data elements can be used in concert with other standards that have far more granular data element sets.
*   Provide a bridge between bibliographic and archival approaches to description.
*   Use a scalable approach that requires neither in-depth description nor extensive changes to records over time.
*   Enable practitioners to have confidence that they are contributing to the application of consistent practice in this emerging area.

This document specifies the core elements that are recommended for describing websites that are both live and have been archived.  It was developed as part of the New York Art Resources Consortium’s Web Archiving Initiative to document web versions of specialist art resources, such as auction catalogues, catalogues raisonnés, artists’ websites, etc. The profile may also be used for other types of web resources for which it is desirable to create rich metadata beyond that which is captured as part of web archiving tools.

I was recently tasked with setting policy for description of Web collections at the University of Miami Libraries. This task spawned a great deal of mental masturbation: Web collections force us to re-think our assumptions about the nature of a collection and its use cases. They force us to be more conscientious about description. In the interest of professional discourse, here’s a re-cap of my (and my colleagues’) thought process re: description of Web collections.

# Finding Aid Examples

These represent the range of options we observed for how to add web archives to a finding aid. In most cases, we chose to follow Emory's model of including them in a collection finding aid as a separate series. We are considering making finding aids of groups of related web archives (e.g. student life) that do not have a related collection so they are discoverable via our collection search.

[**Emory University**](http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/bmfk8)

Web archives is a separate series within the collection finding aid. Example is the Atlanta Hillel Records, Series 3.
</br></br>

[**University of Albany**](https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap043aspace_c5982b776cca73d2d2c086bb587b4f17)

The website is a separate series, which is its own page. Example is the Website of the Business Council of New York State, Inc. Series, part of the Associated Industries of New York State/Business Council of New York State Records.
</br></br>

[**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**](https://archon.library.illinois.edu/index.php?p=digitallibrary/digitalcontent&id=7118)

The website is a separate finding aid. Example is the ATO Fraternity Website.
</br></br>

[**University of Virginia**](https://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu03374.xml&chunk.id=&toc.depth=1&toc.id=&brand=default)

Websites are part of a series with other digital files. Example is the Charlottesville Derby Dames Records, Series V. Virginia is for Shovers.
</br></br>

[**University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**](https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/40417/)

A collection of websites are described in a single finding aid. Example is The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Archives Collected Websites.

This is a practice-oriented action handbook that provides background, resources, and good practices to guide libraries in ethically implementing web analytics with a view towards privacy. This guide contains two main parts, followed by a references section. In Part 1, we detail technical strategies for implementing privacy-aware web analytics. In Part 2, we focus on communication strategies for building support for privacy-aware analytics practices.
