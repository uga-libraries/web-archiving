# Procedure Overview

*I don't know what to put here for this repo.*
*It includes the crawling workflow, but also other web policies.*

# Documentation Overview

*As written, this is supposed to be documentation produced by the workflow.*
*I needed a place for an annotated list of what is in the repo and this seemed like the best fit.*
*Unless we want a separate section for a "table of contents" functionality?*

# Policy Revision History

These policies and procedures were initially developed by Adriane Hanson (Digital Stewardship), Brandon Pieczko (Russell Library), and Steve Armour (Hargrett Library) in 2019 and published to GitHub in 2020.
They were modified by Adriane Hanson and Sarah Causey (MAGIL) in 2022 when MAGIL adopted Archive-It for archiving Georgia state government websites and online publications.
